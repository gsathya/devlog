      <div class="msg"><p>Whee! This was a really productive morning.</p>
<p>Posting devlogs to a mailing-list was a cool idea. It certainly helps
guilt trip^Winspire you to write code, but I couldn't just view my
logs separately or share just my logs with someone. Turns out that
librelist provides a cool rsync API. Interesting. Maybe I could make a
devlog myself? Hmm..</p>
<p>.. and ..</p>
<p>BOOM</p>

<p>I wrote one in Python using <a href="www.makotemplates.org">Mako Template</a> and
Textile. Basically - it rsyncs stuff from librelist, walks through the
emails, parses them, figures out the ones I sent, feeds it to Mako,
creates a static HTML page and stores in /posts, creates an index.html
which lists and links to all the posts. There. All your logs in a
single folder. Symlink it to /var/www/devlog.foo.com and make apache
serve it. ??? PROFIT.</p>
<p>Seriously, for a better readme checkout the source. Also, it's live at
